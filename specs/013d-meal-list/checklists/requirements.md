# Specification Quality Checklist: Meal List (Maaltijdenlijst)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Three open questions surfaced during research (allergen-severity source of truth, the
  "expected children" aggregation not existing anywhere yet, and the relationship between the
  new structured `dietary_type` field and the existing free-text `DietaryRestrictions`) were
  resolved inline during specification (see spec.md's Clarifications section) using the
  codebase's actual data model rather than left as [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers, since each had
  a clear, low-risk resolution grounded in existing entities.
- All items pass; ready for `/speckit-clarify` (to confirm no further ambiguity) and
  `/speckit-plan`.
